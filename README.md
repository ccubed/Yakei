Python service monitor.
* Right now i'm being lazy and putting notes here. Will use Sphinx for final documentation.

## Configuration 
Configuration files are pretty simple. They really don't have any rrequirements. You can space as much as you want or as little and put as many new lines as you feel would make you happy. The only requirements are this general format. 

### Comments
Any line starting with a * is a comment.

### The Domain Block
There should be one ```<Domain>``` block. Inside this block should be some resolvable address in the form ```address:port``` as an attribute.
